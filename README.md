# Water_Quality_Monitoring_System_using_IOTsensors
 This project is a Water Quality Monitoring System designed to continuously measure and report on various water quality parameters using IoT technology. The system leverages a network of sensors and connected devices to provide real-time data and alerts about the water quality in different environments such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and drinking water systems.
